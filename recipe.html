          <h3>What you need
          </h3>
            <a href="">Here’s all you need:

              Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse / New York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.
              
              Butter, garlic and fresh thyme</a>

          <h3>Steak cooking tips!</h3>
            <a href="">Steak cooking tips!
              Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;
              
              Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;
              
              Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust
              
              WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
              
              Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and
              
              REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!

          <h3>What to serve with steak</h3>

          
            <a href="">What to serve with steak
              If you’re after the full, luxury steakhouse experience, serve this steak with Béarnaise sauce, its mashed potato counterpart, Paris Mash, and a side of Garlic Sautéed Spinach.
              
              For a low carb option, serve it with Creamy Mashed Cauliflower – you will be amazed how delicious this is with the help of some extra flavourings!!  And a few more options:
              
              Crispy Smashed Potatoes – pictured! I’m a little mad about these – they’re crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside;
              
              Potato Dauphinoise – good make ahead option, and also if you’re serving a group of people;
              
              Sweet Potato Stacks – something a little different!
              
              Roasted Broccoli – this pairs really well with steak, plus you feel virtuous eating a load of broccoli with this rich buttery steak…
              
              Brown Sugar Glazed Carrots or Sautéed Green Beans with Garlic (make this while the steak is resting)
              
              Cauliflower Cheese – A British comfort food classic!
              
              Fresh garden salad or steamed greens with French Vinaigrette or Italian Dressing
              
              And for a really simple option, just steam a load of veggies and baby potatoes, then douse in the garlic butter left in the skillet. Pretty darn amazing!! – Nagi x
